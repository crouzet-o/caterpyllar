# caterpyllar
A python package for the construction of speech perception and production
experiments

## Version 0.0.2

_WARNING:_ This is a preliminary / alpha version. It is useable but should not
obviously be distributed yet for production purposes. It is mainly here on
github to ease my own development process.

## Fundamentals

### Aims of the package

This package aims at providing dedicated functions for the rapid development of
interfaces for speech perception and production experiments. It is mainly based
on [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) but provides a "higher level" interface for
some classical needs in human experimentation interfaces (specifically for
studying speech production and perception) which should ease the development
process.


### TODO list

* Introduce classes and methods instead of functions;
* Define visual interfaces with specific needs;
* Design and introduce XML config file interpretation in cooperation with csv
  lists;
* Deal with management of local ./ global variables
