# caterpyllar
A python package for the construction of speech perception and production experiments

### Version 0.0.1

_WARNING:_ This is a preliminary / alpha version. It is useable but should not obviously be distributed yet
for production purposes. It is mainly here on github to ease my own development process.

## Fundamentals

### Aims of the package

This package aims at providing dedicated functions for the rapid development of interfaces for speech
perception and production experiments. It is mainly based on Pygame (http://www.pygame.org) but provides
a "higher level" interface for some classical needs in human experimentation interfaces (specifically for
studying speech production and perception) which should ease the development process.
