# caterpyllar
A python package for the construction of speech perception and production
experiments

## Version 0.0.2

_WARNING:_ This is a preliminary / pre-alpha version. It is useable (sort of)
but should not obviously be distributed yet for production purposes. Also
there's no documentation as for now. It is mainly here on github to ease my own
development process.

## Fundamentals

### Aims of the package

This package aims at providing dedicated functions for the rapid development of
interfaces for speech perception and production experiments. It is mainly based
on [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) but provides (well... will provide) a
"higher level" interface for some classical needs in human experimentation
interfaces (specifically for studying speech production and perception) which
should ease the development process.


### TODO list

* Introduce classes and methods instead of functions;
* Define visual interfaces with specific needs;
* Design and introduce XML config file interpretation in cooperation with csv
  lists;
